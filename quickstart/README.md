# Stackable Quickstart

## Quickstart Script
stackable-quickstart.sh is a shell script that will install Stackable on a single node, ideal for development, testing and evaulation. It will get your from a bare OS installation to a working cluster in a few minutes.


## Requirements
Supported operating systems are:
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Debian 10
- CentOS 7 and 8
- RHEL 7 and 8

- The host running Stackable Quickstart needs Internet access in order to download 
- Resource requirement (RAM, CPU) will depend on the number and type of services you are deploying using quickstart

## Configuration
In most cases you can use the default configuration to create a Quickstart cluster. You can customise the service configuration by updating the files in the conf/ directory.
